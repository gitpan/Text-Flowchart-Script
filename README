Text/Flowchart/Script version 0.01
==================================

Text::Flowchart is a tool for generating flowcharts in
ASCII style. However, users have to process some repeated
things themselves, such as variable declaration, parentheses.
As to this point, Text::Flowchart::Script defines a simple
language for users to create text flowcharts much easier.
